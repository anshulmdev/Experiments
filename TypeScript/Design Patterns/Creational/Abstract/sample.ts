// themselves. A family of products may have several variants,
// but the products of one variant are incompatible with the
// products of another variant.

// to a single variant. The factory guarantees that the
// resulting products are compatible. Signatures of the concrete
// factory's methods return an abstract product, while inside
// the method a concrete product is instantiated.
